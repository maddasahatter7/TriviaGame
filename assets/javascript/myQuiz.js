// Hello, hello. Madison here. Today I spent some time learning about json. this file will be able to group and 
// hold all of my data (quiz questions). The cool thing that I learned is that json will make it so that I can 
// place all of the correct answers as "choice1" each time, yet the questions will 
// still be placed randomly on the screen for anyone who goes to take the quiz. I am writing this so that you 
// know I have been doing research at home on this and that I get it so far. I feel like using this to store
//  my questions makes things easier and more organized. So yeah, ha-ha. there is my disclaimer!
